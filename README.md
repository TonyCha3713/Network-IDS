# Network-IDS
Network Intrusion Detection System with ML models for accurate classification
Developed a real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leveraging the NSL-KDD dataset to identify malicious network activities, including port scans, SYN floods, UDP floods, ICMP attacks, and brute force attempts. The system uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on 41 network features, achieving an accuracy of 94.3% during evaluation. Implemented live packet sniffing with Scapy to analyze traffic, detect anomalies, and trigger real-time alerts, monitored critical ports like SSH (22), HTTP (80), and MySQL (3306) with threshold-based detection for early attack prevention.
